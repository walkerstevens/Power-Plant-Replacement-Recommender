Step 1
- Download s3://nrel-pds-nsrdb/v3/tmy/nsrdb_tmy-2020.h5 a storage or mount the remote endpoint as a local drive

Step 2: Get the yearly aggregateed TMY data of all USA Renewable Energy Powerplants, for Solar and Wind types => aggregate_tmy_powerplant_coordinates.ipynb
- For 3274 SOLAR powerplants
    - Yearly mean&std averages : us_powerplants_new_solar.csv
    - Yearly averages of bucketed wind/temp data: us_powerplants_new_solar2.csv
- For 1137 WIND powerplants
    - Yearly mean&std averages : us_powerplants_new_wind.csv
    - Yearly averages of bucketed wind/temp data: us_powerplants_new_wind2.csv
=> 10K USA powerplants were filtered out of 35K global powerplants
=> Used to train capacity factor prediction model for solar and wind, respectively

Step 3: Get the yearly aggregated data for ALL US 4km x 4km grids: means, stds, and bucketed wind/temperature data => aggregate_tmy_all_coordinates.ipynb)
- For 546K in-land USA coordinates filtered from 2M coordinates including territorial water (all USA coordinates based on 4km x 4km grid)
- Aggregate 8760 hourly data into a yearly average value for 24 TMY weather features,
    - Yearly mean averages : yearly_variables_us_coordinates_mean.csv
    - Yearly std averages: yearly_variables_us_coordinates_std.csv
    - Yearly averages of bucketed wind/temp data: yearly_variables_us_coordinates_others.csv

Step 4: Concatenate three datasets into one (concatenate_three_tmy_datasets.ipynb)
